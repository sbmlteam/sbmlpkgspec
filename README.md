üèÅ Recent news and activities
------------------------------

_September 2017_: Fixed another bug in footers and headers of the appendix section, caused by an incomplete fix in version 1.7.2.  Hopefully this is the last of it.

_August 2017_: Fixed bug in commands for referencing sections, caused by a poor implementation of `\apdx`. This fixes the problem that references to sections would sometimes end up as `Section Appendix 3.3.12`.  (Thanks to Lucian Smith for reporting this issue.)

_May 2017_: Moved the SBMLPkgClass directory to a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec), away from its original location as a subdirectory in the general [SBML project area on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/sbml/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/project/).  There are no code, LaTeX or licensing changes in this release.

‚ô•Ô∏è Please cite the SBMLPkgSpec paper and the version you use

‚òÄ Introduction
-----------------------------

[SBML](http://sbml.org) is an XML-based format for storing and communicating computational models of biological processes.  SBML Level 3 _packages_ are optional modular extensions to the core of SBML to add constructs that support additional features.  The [specification documents](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications) for SBML Level 3 packages define the syntax and semantics of individual SBML Level 3 packages.

The [SBMLPkgSpec](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec) class for LaTeX provides a standard format for SBML Level 3 package specification documents. It provides a uniform look-and-feel to the family of SBML Level 3 documents, and provides guidance to specification authors about the information that should be included in each specification.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation and configuration
---------------------------------

Before using SBMLPkgClass in a document, you will need to download the distribution or [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this GitHub repository to your computer, and adjust your TeX/LaTeX installation to find your copy of SBMLPkgClass.  (The instructions for this differ depending on your system; various tips can be found, e.g., on [tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te).)


‚ñ∫ Usage 
-------

Once you have a copy of the package and your LaTeX installation can find it, the basic approach to using SBMLPkgClass is simple: you create a `.tex` file in your favorite text editor and start with a template such as this example:

```latex
\documentclass{sbmlpkgspec}
\begin{document}

\packageTitle{Example}
\packageVersion{Version 1 (Draft)}
\packageVersionDate{14 August 2011}
\packageGeneralURL{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/Example}
\packageThisVersionURL{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/Example_14_August_2011}

}

\maketitlepage
\maketableofcontents

\section{...}
...
\end{document}
```

However, there are few more considerations and guidelines besides this.  **Please make sure to read the [user's guide to SBMLPkgSpec](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec/blob/master/sbmlpkgspec-doc.pdf)** in the file titled [sbmlpkgspec-doc.pdf](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbmlpkgspec/blob/master/sbmlpkgspec-doc.pdf).    This file explains everything you need to know to use SBMLPkgClass, and includes tips for how to make the most of this specialized LaTeX document class.
